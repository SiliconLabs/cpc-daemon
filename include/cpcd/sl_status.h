 *           instead.
 *           For example, the buffer would either contain "SL_STATUS_FAIL" if that status string is
 *           enabled, or "SL_STATUS_0x0001" if the string is disabled, as SL_STATUS_FAIL's
 *           value is 0x0001.
 *
 * @param    status         The status code from which to obtain the status string.
 *
 * @param    buffer         Pointer to a buffer in which the status string will be copied. A terminating
 *                          null-character will be appended after the copied status string.
 *
 * @param    buffer_length  Maximum number of characters that can be written in the buffer, including the
 *                          terminating null-character. If the status string would be longer than the
 *                          available length, it will be truncated and a null-terminating character will
 *                          be the last character contained in the buffer.
 *
 * @return                  The number of characters that would have been written if the buffer_length had been
 *                          sufficiently large, not counting the terminating null character.
 *                          If the status code is invalid, 0 or a negative number is returned.
 *                          Notice that only when this returned value is strictly positive and less than
 *                          buffer_length, the status string has been completely written in the buffer.
